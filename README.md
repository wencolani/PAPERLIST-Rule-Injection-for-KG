| - | 2020 | CIKM | [**SLRE**][Knowledge Graph Embedding Preserving Soft Logical Regularity](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3340531.3412055)| Constrains entity embedding into a non-negative and bounded space and relation embedding following semantic of rule based on ComplEx.  Relation embedding regularity are designed following the diea that if head <- body, then grounding(body) < gounding(head). | ** | [code][https://github.com/StudyGroup-lab/SLRE]
| - | 2019 | arXiv | [**KALE**][Logic Rules Powered Knowledge Graph Embedding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.03772.pdf) | Represent triples as first-order logic to make rules and facts into same semantic space. Design first-order logic formula calculation applied to TransE/H/R. Inference rules, transitivity rules and antysymmetry rules are considered. | * |
| - | 2019 | arXiv | [**LogicENN**][LogicENN: A Neural Based Knowledge Graph Embedding Model with Logical Rules](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.07141.pdf) | Propose a fully expressive KGE and injecting rules following Fatorizing YAGO | * | |

| - | 2018 | PAKDD | [**TARE**][Embedding Knowledge Graphs Based on Transitivity and Asymmetry of Rules](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-93037-4_12) | Constrain entity and relation embedding to be non-negative via squaring their embedding. Rules of r1->r2 and r1&r2->r3 are considered. TARE is applied on ComplEx. It generate positive and negative samples for rules following operation on triples and devise loss function for rules. | *** | 
| - | 2018 | ACL | [**ComplEx-NNE_AER**][Improving Knowledge Graph Embedding Using Simple Constrains](https://aclanthology.org/P18-1011.pdf) | It propose non-negativity constrains on entity representation and approximation entailment constrains on relation representation based on ComplEx. Rules of r1->r2 is considered. Rules are from AMIE. | ***** | [code](https://github.com/iieir-km/ComplEx-NNE_AER) |
| - | 2016 | EMNLP | [Lifted Rule Injection for Relation Embedding](https://aclanthology.org/D16-1146.pdf) | Constrain entity-pair representation to real-valued vectors via sigmoid function to approximate boolean entity tuples. Constrain E(r1)< E(r2) element-wisely if r1-> r2. Zero-shot experiment is included. | ***** | 
| - | 2015 | IJCAI | [Knowledge Base Completion Using Embeddings and Rules](https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/15/Papers/264.pdf) | Frame rule injection as ILP problem. Rules of Noisy Obervation, argument type expectation, at-most-one restraint and simple implication are considered.  | ***** |  [code](https://github.com/StudyGroup-lab/SLRE) | 
| - | 2015 | NAACL | [Injecting Logical Background Knowledge into Embeddings for Relation Extraction](https://aclanthology.org/N15-1118.pdf) | Unsing groundings for injection based on matrix factorization method with entity pair embedding. It propose two baselines 1) pre-injection that first infer new triples via rules and then train model, and 2) post-injection that train model first then do rule inference. | ***** | 
| - | 2015 | EMNLP | [Traversing Knowledge Graphs in Vector Space](https://aclanthology.org/D15-1038.pdf) | Applied path to train KGE, enableing KGE ansering path qureies. The key point is devise inverse relation representation for different KGEs. This could be regarded as the first step of Complex Query Answering task. | - | |
